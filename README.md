# Contract-Stackelberg Appendix Summary

The appendix of our study, "A Contract-Stackelberg Framework for Mitigating Timing Games in Proof of Stake Blockchain Networks," includes comprehensive supplementary materials that deepen the understanding and application of the concepts discussed. Key sections of the appendix are outlined below:

### 1. List of Symbols
Provides a detailed list of all symbols used throughout the manuscript, explaining each symbol's specific meaning within the context of our mathematical formulations and analyses.

### 2. Experimental Parameters
Lists all parameters used in our experiments, essential for replicating the experimental conditions and understanding the framework within which the validators operate.

### 3. Detailed Proofs
Offers extensive derivations related to the optimization problem formulations used for designing contracts for validators, including conditions for optimality based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) framework.

### 4. Lagrangian Formulations
- **Stage 1 - Leader’s Game:** Describes the Lagrangian setup for the leader’s optimization in the Stackelberg game, focusing on reward allocation.
- **Stage 2 - Follower’s Game:** Details the Lagrangian for each validator’s optimization problem, addressing how validators respond to incentives and constraints.

### 5. Analysis of Acceptance Rates
Discusses the analysis of acceptance rates for Stake, Effort, and Reward, substantiating the effectiveness of the normalization process implemented. This section also includes comparative analysis figures illustrating improvements in acceptance rates post-normalization.

### 6. Proof of Stackelberg Equilibrium Uniqueness
Provides a rigorous proof demonstrating the uniqueness of the Stackelberg Equilibrium within our Contract-Stackelberg Game, underlining the theoretical robustness of our model.
